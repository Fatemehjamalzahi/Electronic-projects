Smart Voltage Level Detection using AVR

Description
A microcontroller-based system that reads analog voltage levels and makes logical decisions to control LEDs based on threshold values.

## Tools & Libraries
- AVR Microcontroller (ATmega series)  
- AVR-GCC / Atmel Studio  
- LCD Library  
- <util/delay.h>

Features
- ADC signal reading from input sensor  
- Logic decision for turning LED ON/OFF  
- Real-time data display on LCD  
- Accurate timing using _delay_ms()
