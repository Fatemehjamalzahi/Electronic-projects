Blinking Lights using 555 Timer IC

 Description
A simple circuit that uses the 555 timer in astable mode to generate clock pulses and make two LEDs blink alternately, creating a "dancing light" effect.

Components
- NE555 Timer IC  
- LEDs (x2)  
- Resistors  
- Capacitors  

Features
- Implemented clock generation with 555 IC  
- Designed and tested in Proteus simulation  
- Adjustable blinking speed by changing RC values  

Tools
Proteus, Multisim
